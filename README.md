# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```

# Notes
- Ethereum on local machine, before this it was hard to test it
- _createZombie is the private method
- test the code before going forward `npx hardhat clean --global` if it fails
- how do we run the smart contract. it runs on the blockchain.
